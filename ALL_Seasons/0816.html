<p><strong>Lisa Kudrow:</strong> (voiceover) Previously on Friends</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is talking to Ross]</p>
<b>

</b><p>Joey: Theres this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, its
complicated.  Shes with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I
could never do that to the guy, yknow?  Ccause were really good
friends.</p>
<b>

</b><p>Ross: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he a good guy?</p>
<b>

</b><p>Joey: Yeah, hes the best.</p>
<b>

</b><p>Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.</p>
<b>

</b><p>Joey: Oh, I dont know.</p>
<b>

</b><p>Ross: Joey, its worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.</p>
<b>

</b><p>Joey: I do! So much! I cant stop thinking about her! I cant sleep,
I</p>
<b>

</b><p>Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen
to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until)</p>
<b>

</b><p>Joey: Its Rachel.</p>

<p>[Fade to Black, then fade in again with Ross stopped at the doorway.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (closes the door) Did you umIm sorry, did you just say
its Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Um, youyou like Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yes. I like Rachel.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uhHey-hey, yknow,
yknow who else I like? You! And it-it doesnt get said enough. I like you Ross.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! </p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, but its not a big deal.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Its not a big deal? Oh, Im sorry I justum, Iwhat
about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I likeyou-you cant
stop thinking about her. Like how you cant sleep?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Im an actor, yknow? As-as a group, we tend to be over
dramatic.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Rachel whos carrying my baby? Rachel?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look no, I-I know its bad, and I know its wrong. Okay? But-but
its not like anythings ever gonna happen. Yknow? These-these are just
feelings, theyre gonna go away.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yknow what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross dont</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (stops) I justyknowI-I just have oneRachel?! </p>

<p>(He exits and starts to walk away, passes a window, stops, and says
"Rachel?!" again. Joey sighs and turns around to face Gunther.)</p>

<p><strong>Gunther:</strong> Rachel?!!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Chandler are on the couch.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) Shes growing inside you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Whoa!!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow that was a big one.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Oh hey you guys!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh hey!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there
for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. Thats why
I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. Hell find me.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each
other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well last night, I met Monicas.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other
half.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Come on, dont be crazy. (To Rachel) You dont think
theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at
him.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (To Phoebe) Well, whats he like?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well hes tall.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He has brown hair.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Of course, of course.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> He works with food!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh sure. Older?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Obviously, and hes British.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I was just gonna ask!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah? And, hes-hes so centered and mature and confident.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre
talking about.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I
butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre
still gonna date him?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross is opening the door to Monica.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I just talked to Joey, I justI want to see how you were.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh yknow, I stillI cant believe it. Joey and Rachel I
mean its Its like you and me going out, only weirder!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, I know youre hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,
but dont say that again.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then hed be the
stepfather of my child.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, I dont think thats something we need to worry about!
First of all hes-hes never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if
he did you have no idea how shed react.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sure, because women never like Joey. Yknow, I think hes a
virgin.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joeyhes not even thinking about going after Rachel!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hes not?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No! All hes thinking about is how youre taking this! I mean,
listen its totally freaking him out. Hes talking about moving to Vermont.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Why?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hate him? I No, I dont hate him. (Pause) Its just
its Rachel, yknow?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey I cant even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I
dont want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that
youre still his friend.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay. Okay, Ill talk to him.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars
into Vermont money.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are on the couch as Phoebe enters with
Monicas soul mate.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh! Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandlers hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monicas
hand.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (mouths to Phoebe) What?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (cough talks) Soul mate.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So, what have you guys been doing?</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the
sun-dried tomatoes at that place?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know! What is this, 1985?!</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Thats exactly what I said. Phoebe, isnt that strange.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Not really.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)
On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still theres staring.) No?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Well, Octavio, 27&amp;7Oh! And theres this great little place,
Alessandros.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God! Thats my restaurant, Im the chef there.</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Youre kidding me!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu,
once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna
talk about me, Im gonna go with you. </p>

<p>(They go over to the counter and Chandler moves closer to Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What are you doing?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And
the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Theyre just talking, and yknow what? Just because I think
theyre soul mates doesnt mean anythings gonna happen.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (returning) Phoebe, good work.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! Oh hes great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at
Phoebe.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Dont worry, well find you someone else.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joeys Apartment, theres a knock on the door and Joey answers it to
Ross.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I dont want to hit you.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh what then? Kick me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (getting worried) Bite me?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no I dont want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to
tell you that Im not mad at you andand that I certainly do not hate you. I
just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh nowHey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or
something?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uhyeah sure. (Enters.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel
left. I dont</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something
okay? I uhI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do
anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Thank you.</p>

<p>(They clink glasses and take a drink. Ross likes it, Joey hates it. Then Ross sees Joey
hating it, mimics he hates it as well.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Anyway, it uhlook itll justtake me a while to get over
her, thats all. Im not even sure how to do that, I mean Ive never been
in love before so</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?! Youre in love with her.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, I thought you knew that.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Umm, no.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I dont want to feel this way. Honest. I
just keep thinking, "Ah, Ill get over this." Yknow? I justIt
just keeps gettin harder. I dont, I dont know what to do. Yknow?
What do I do?</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I think you need to tell her how you feel.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay thats the green stuff talkin.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, Im serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if
shes not where you are, then you can start to move past this.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But what if uhand Im not saying she will beBut</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> If she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about it
shouldnt stand in the way.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Are you sure?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Look if-if shes gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is
she couldnt find a better guy. So</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey thanks.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So when do you think youre gonna talk to her?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God I have to tell her! I havent even thought about what I
will say. What should I say?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Im understanding, but lets not get carried away.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Im sorry, youre right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another
sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys
another sip.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Chandler are watching Monica and Don talk.]</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> so Ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing
more on the cheese side of things.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Cheese you say? Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don?</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Excuse me?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Cheese, its smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, Im one of the people who
thinks the smellier the better.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Me too! Yeah, Chandler cant stand it. He wont even allow me
to have blue cheese in the house.</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> And youre still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler tries
to but fails.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You know what Id love to do? I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheeseNot even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.
Ah, and pastries (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, Im really not high, its
just I used to be fat.</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, Ive got a
great little villa you can stay at.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Is it made of cheese?</p>

<p><b>Don:</b> No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldnt that be incredible?!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Id move in tomorrow!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Im so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What do we do?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I dont know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I
dont know how you fight that.</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Ross and Rachel's, Joey walks up to knock on the door, but stops.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand
up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as
Rachel opens the door and startles him.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey? Whats up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay whats up?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Here? In the hall? What are we animals?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well honey, Im late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that Iwant to have dinner with
you tonight. Thats all.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to
meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay. Thats good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what
youre gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles
Joey again.) Dont you people ever knock?!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are entering.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Id like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldnt that be nice?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here,
browsing through the personals.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Jeez! What is with you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Im sorry, did you say cheese?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> All right, whats going on?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in
that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in
your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> No. But Im sure (mimics Don) tomatoes does.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I dont believe in soul mates either.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> You dont?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together.
I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really
hard.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> So youyou dont want to live with Don in a cheese house?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No, Ive had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard
that would be to clean?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I love you.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> I know.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I
found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica
doesnt look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.</p>

<p>[Scene: A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are having dinner.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he
touches my stomach. I mean Im really worried the babys not going to like him.
(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason(Exhales
slowly)Is it hot in here?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No. Not-not for me, but why dont you take off your sweater?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin
doing Hobbs.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater
out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Huh. Wow, I wouldnt think Hobbs would like that so much.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh How long have we known each other?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um, sevene-e-eight, <b>eight</b> years. Wow.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh-huh, long time.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But over the past few weeks</p>

<p>(A waiter runs over interrupting Joey.)</p>

<p><b>Waiter:</b> Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a
couple specials tonight</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Actually uh, could you give us a second?</p>

<p><b>Waiter:</b> Sure. Sure. (Turns away, then turns back) Seconds up! (Joey glares
at him.) Notthat kind of table. (He walks away.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> So you were saying?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Im not quite sure.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I
said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and
ummnow here we are.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, here we are. Uhh I I think Imfalling in love
with you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stunned) What?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Im falling in love with you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, youre kidding! Oh,
its a joke! (Laughs.) Its funny. Its funny. I dont get it. (Joey
doesnt say any thing and Rachel realizes its not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay.
Umm I-Iuh, wow. Are you uh How did umm When?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Does it really matter?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You dont have to say anything.
You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay,
you gotta say something!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> But. (Hangs his head down.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Joey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah-yeah right. Thats okay. Thats fine. Thats uh,
pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, its no big deal. All right? I think
Im gonna go. (Stands up.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> No! Joey please! Please dont! Please dont leave like this!
Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Dont start doing that. You cant do that Rach, cause then
youre gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to
her.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Can I? (Hug him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Sure! </p>

<p>(They hug.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh Joey honey I dontI dont want to lose</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey-hey-hey, hey! You cant. Okay? Ever!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Im so sorry.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh no-no Rach, please, dont be sorry. Okay? Dont be sorry.
(They hug again.) Yknow I was only kidding you.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, that was a real good one.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are still hugging as a waiter walks by the table
to talk to the annoying waiter from before who is watching.]</p>

<p><b>Waiter No. 2:</b> Is this your table?</p>

<p><b>Waiter:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Waiter No. 2:</b> God, youre gonna be here all night!</p>

<p><b>Waiter:</b> I know! I havent even read them the specials yet!</p>

<p><b>Waiter No. 2:</b> Whats the matter with them?</p>

<p><b>Waiter:</b> I dont know. I think maybe one of them is dying. (Pause) I kinda
hope its the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.) The guy is really cute!</p>
